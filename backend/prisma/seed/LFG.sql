Purpose of report: This report seeks: Endorsement of the Masterplan and Masterplan Framework for development of the Kirklees Local Plan housing allocation at Dewsbury Riverside. Authority for the Council to enter into an agreement with the Combined Authority to accept Local Growth Fund grant to facilitate infrastructure delivery at Dewsbury Riverside. 1.1 Dewsbury Riverside is a key site within the North Kirklees Growth Zone which is identified as a spatial priority area for housing growth in the Leeds City Region Strategic Economic Plan. The site is allocated for housing in the recently adopted Kirklees Local Plan with capacity for up to 4000 homes, of which approximately 1869 are proposed to be developed within the Local Plan period up to 2031. 1.2 The vision for Dewsbury Riverside is to create a sustainable urban extension that will deliver social, environmental and economic benefits, provide a mix of high quality homes of different tenures together with community infrastructure to create a sustainable, vibrant mixed community; and to retain, expand and enhance existing green infrastructure, connecting new and existing communities to healthy lifestyle opportunities. The scale of the development is intended to be large enough to allow a degree of “market repositioning” and thereby to act as a catalyst for the regeneration of the wider area. 1.3 The masterplan and masterplan framework together set out the \'what and where\' for the development of the allocation. The masterplan framework brings together a significant amount of technical and design work that has been undertaken, it explains the context for the masterplan and sets out the high level phasing of development across the site. The masterplan sets out the distribution of and inter-relationship between land uses across the allocation, the points of access into the site from the local highway network and the internal layout of the site. 1.4 The masterplan has been designed around a series of neighbourhoods radiating from a central urban park, new local centre and primary school, phased to be delivered early in the development to act as a catalyst and driver for the early development of the scheme and that form the heart of the urban village centre.
