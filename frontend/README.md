# React Boilerplate with TypeScript
This is a scalable boilerplate built with React.js and TypeScript, aimed at enterprise-level applications. It provides a streamlined setup for creating highly maintainable, production-ready React applications with integrated testing, linting, formatting, and environment management.

# Backend Support: 
This frontend is paired with a fully integrated Node.js backend, providing a robust and synchronized full-stack setup for smooth development and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16+)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 7+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation
Clone the Repository:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siddhant-ahire/react-boilerplate-ts.git

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
    cd react-boilerplate-ts
    npm install

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
  ```npm install```

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```npm run build```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

```npm test```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
You can run unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

```npm run lint```
Lints your code using ESLint.
This helps in maintaining a clean and error-free codebase.

```npm run format```
Formats the code in src/ folder using Prettier.

```npm run eject```
Removes the react-scripts abstraction. Note: this is irreversible!

Environment-based Commands
These commands are used to run/build the project with different environment configurations:
```
npm run start:dev

npm run start:staging

npm run start:prod

npm run build:dev

npm run build:staging

npm run build:prod
```
These commands use the env-cmd package to load specific environment variables.

## Environment Setup
You need to configure environment variables in .env files for different environments like development, staging, and production.

Create .env.development, .env.staging, and .env.production files based on the following example:
# Example .env file
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5002
REACT_APP_ENV=development
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=example.apps.googleusercontent.com
```
## Running the Project

```
For development:
npm run start:dev

For staging:
npm run start:staging or npm run start

For production:
npm run start:prod
```

## Building for Production
To build the app for production, run:```npm run build:prod```
This will create an optimized production build in the build/ directory.

## Linting & Formatting
To run ESLint and auto-fix issues:```npm run lint```

To format your code using Prettier:```npm run format```
