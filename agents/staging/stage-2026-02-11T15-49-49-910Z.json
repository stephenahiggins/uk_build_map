          "rawText": "Two planning applications for new homes – some in Birkenshaw and some in Birstall – are set to be determined next week. The applications to be decided by Kirklees Council’s planning committee on Thursday, July 31 include plans for 21 homes on a plot of land in Birkenshaw which backs onto the local Liberal Club. The site is described as a “heavily-vegetated” vacant plot, previously housing a bowling green and allotments. According to supporting documents, Croft Street was stopped up and closed more than 30 years ago, but is still used for vehicular access to the club and pedestrian access. The former Church of St John in Birstall has been earmarked for 21 apartments. The new two-storey properties would be a range of two, three and four bedrooms and be accessible from Old Lane via Croft Street. The plans also feature a new car park and beer garden for the liberal club. In total, 41 comments have been received in response to the application from members of the public, with 29 of these in objection, seven general comments and five supporting comments. One resident wrote: “The village is already being overdeveloped and becoming crowded; it does not have the infrastructure or facilities to sustain this level of development. The space should be left as a green space and be used to benefit the community as a whole. Another said: “I think this development is a great addition to the area, the contractor is a supporter and contributor to the local area. It will provide better footpaths, car parking and lighting and make the area safer. The developer has listened to the needs of the community and taken this onboard within the scheme. The area has always been an unused and uncared for dumping ground. At least with the new development it will be a nicely maintained area. Kirklees Council officers have recommended that the plans be approved subject to several conditions including that three of the homes are affordable, there is a £57k contribution to off-site public open space and that £10k goes to funding waiting restrictions at the site access onto Old Lane. There are also plans to turn a Grade-II listed former church in Birstall into flats. Plans to bring 21 apartments to Wesley House have been recommended for approval by council officers, unless it is home to bats. The property – formerly the Church of St John – sits off Huddersfield Road and Chapel Lane in the centre of Birstall. The plans have been recommended for approval by council officers subject to the outcome of a bat survey. If bats are found, officers say this would be a “strong” reason for refusal. Wesley House is located within a conservation area. The applicant – Medipharm Bradford Ltd – says that, while the property has been marketed for sale for several years, there has been “little or no interest”. It is now subsequently earmarked for housing. Planning permission was previously granted to convert the building into 21 units but this has since expired.",

Acting on behalf of Mileway, the pan-European logistics real estate company, P4 Planning has submitted a full planning application for a 7,118 sqm (76,614 sq ft) new industrial scheme in Birstall. The plans will pave the way for the transformation of the land at Norquest Industrial Estate, creating a strategic new hub for industrial, storage and distribution tenants. A spokesman said: \"P4 has provided extensive planning advice in relation to the brownfield site, which is designated as an employment area in the Kirklees Local Plan 2019. \"This planning application seeks approval for the demolition of an existing warehouse and workshop and the erection of four speculative employment units; comprising two self-contained buildings and a third building divided into two smaller units.\" Mileway has around 1,400 assets across the UK, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the Nordics. Thomas O’Kane, Senior Planner at P4 Planning said: \"Our client has been careful to create plans which will transform the site, removing buildings that are no longer fit for purpose and replacing them with modern, purpose-built, sustainable units for a variety of uses. The spokesman added: \"When delivered the scheme will deliver much needed investment and jobs which aligns with Kirklees Council’s plans for sustainable economic growth. The scheme, which is strategically located close to junction 27 of the M62, has the potential to create up to 150 new jobs.\"",

The consultation received over 2,112 responses from individuals, organisations and businesses across the district, this level of response provides a high confidence level that the feedback is representative. Using an industry standard sample size calculation to achieve a confidence level of 99%, with a 3% margin of error, the survey would have needed to achieve 1,842 responses. Since the survey concluded officers have completed the analysis of responses and the redraft of the strategy document, to reflect the responses to the consultation. The purpose of this report is to present the results of the consultation and engagement activity undertaken, to seek feedback and to seek endorsement so the Strategy can be finalised and adopted. A better approach to transport in Kirklees will help to deliver against core Council priorities: good transport is a core factor in the support of investment and regeneration; it helps places to thrive and allows communities to become more connected. A stronger focus on more sustainable forms of transport, which supports mode shift, will help to deliver a greener, healthier Kirklees and work in tandem with our Net Zero ambitions. The adoption of a distinct Transport Strategy will direct this approach and allow the Council to work to better transport for Kirklees and its communities.",

          "rawText": "West Yorkshire is planning a new Mass Transit network - a modern, high-quality public transport system that could include trams, light rail or advanced bus rapid transit. These forms of new transport will make the Weaver Network more accessible for everyone. It is a once-in-a-generation investment that could help improve how we travel, support new homes and jobs, tackle climate change and create better places to live. Kirklees Council will deliver the project in partnership with the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, Bradford City Council, Calderdale Council, Leeds City Council and Wakefield Council. This consultation is about how development should be planned around Mass Transit, not the routes themselves. The West Yorkshire councils and the West Yorkshire Combined Authority are working together to create a shared planning framework called a Joint Development Plan Document ('joint DPD'). The aim is to make sure new homes, business spaces, services and public spaces are built in the right places, in the right way, to maximise the benefits from Mass Transit. The Spatial Development Framework (SDF) has been developed by the five West Yorkshire local planning authorities, supported by the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, to bring together our region's ambitions for building, regeneration and a more inclusive economy into a statutory document. The SDF is set out in the joint Development Plan Document. If adopted by the local planning authorities, the Mass Transit Spatial Development Framework will provide a new set of policies for our region sitting alongside local authorities' Local Plans. The Mass Transit scheme is at an early stage with the preparation of the business case currently underway. The UK planning system is designed to support opportunities for residents to have their say on how their local area is shaped by planning. It takes time to develop and approve proposals. Launching a consultation now allows enough time to develop robust and community informed proposals that can be finalised alongside the detailed business case to Government for the proposed first phase of the Mass Transit network. The first stage consultation will run for six weeks from Thursday 29 January to Thursday 12 March. This will inform a further consultation on the Spatial Development Framework in 2026 and allow submission to the planning inspectorate for in 2027.",

What a strategy is A strategy document is a plan for the future. It details the present situation, outlines the goals or objectives, and shows what action you may take to get there. It often includes a vision, objectives and policies. The vision being what you want to achieve, your objectives being the goals which underpin the vision, and the policies guiding decisions that help achieve the vision and goals. A strategy document does not typically include a list of schemes, projects or works to be completed. Instead, it outlines the work that needs to be done to reach a specific goal.",

We're investing in our infrastructure, encouraging behaviour change and making sustainable modes the easy and affordable choice. Dewsbury and Huddersfield will benefit from the multi-billion-pound TransPennine Route Upgrade investment, making the trains more frequent, faster, cleaner and reliable between Manchester, Leeds and York. Walking and cycling within Kirklees has been improved, building on the success of the 7.3 mile Spen Valley Greenway. The Canal towpath between Slaithwaite and Milnsbridge is part of a £2.7 million investment to develop long-term accessibility on a continuous active travel route to Huddersfield Town Centre. A £14 million revamp of Dewsbury Bus Station has been announced to make bus travel more attractive for residents, businesses, and commuters. Coupled with the 'Mayor's Fares' £2 cap on bus tickets, buses are becoming the affordable choice for people to move within Kirklees and to neighbouring places like Halifax, Wakefield, Bradford and Bingley. Local people and organisations are also making a huge difference. Cycle and scooter storage has been installed in local schools through the Mac's Bikes memorial fund to promote active travel by students and teachers, with the charity 'Streetbikes' striving to transform people's lives by providing cycling sessions for all abilities and repairing and re-homing unwanted or donated bikes back into the community.",

The planning applications were prepared as part of a package to allow the cumulative impacts of the development at each junction to be considered. The planning submission was supported by an overarching planning statement, a strategic Transport Assessment, and an Environmental Statement. Because the improvement scheme at Ollerton is in close proximity to a SSSI (Site of Specific Scientific Interest), a decision was made to undertake a voluntary Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and submit an Environmental Statement. This process included consultation with relevant statutory consultees to understand the issues to be addressed in the EIA.

Other works include a new two-lane free-flow road from the M60 northbound to westbound to replace the existing single-lane configuration, and conversion of the hard shoulder between junctions 17 and 18 of the M60 into a permanent fifth lane in both directions. Improvements to signage, signalling and drainage will also be carried out. Costain was appointed in 2021 by client Highways England (now National Highways) to deliver the design and construction contract. The Simister Island scheme is intended to reduce congestion on the interchange, which carries around 90,000 vehicles each day. Jacobs is acting as delivery partner on the project. Speaking to Construction News last month following the group’s interim results announcement, Costain chief executive Alex Vaughan said the firm expects to begin construction work shortly.",

National Highways said it has almost completed the main part of the scheme on the M62 between junctions 28 and 29 – installation of a concrete central barrier – and that the scheme is expected to finish in August, ahead of autumn as initially expected. The scheme has seen the waterproofing of the central reserve of two structures, alongside improvements to around three miles of drainage and general maintenance. Scaffolding and encapsulation of the footbridge were due to begin on Monday (17 July), to allow the deck to be lifted from its bearings. Project manager Daniel Edwards said: ‘We appreciate this scheme has already caused delays on the road for many drivers since we began this work in January, and we have done everything we can to minimise delays. ‘We are pleased to say the barrier is now all but finished and we now just need to install the improved lighting. ‘At the same time, we're also going to carry out remedial work to the Dolphin Lane footbridge near Thorpe on the Hill. This will mean we can carry out two sets of work under one section of traffic management without having to put any further temporary barriers, cones or closures in place – minimising disruption to the public.' There will be five overnight closures between 17 and 21 July between junctions 28 and 29 to allow National Highways to put up the scaffolding.",

A package of interventions has been developed by the South East Scotland Transport Transition Group, which involves Edinburgh, East Lothian, Midlothian, West Lothian, Fife, Scottish Borders, Falkirk and Clackmannanshire councils. These aim to encourage and incentivise bus travel as an attractive, sustainable mode of transport as lockdown restrictions are lifted and traffic begins to return to previous levels. Amongst proposals are the introduction or extension of bus lanes including on the A90 citybound between Cramond Brig and Barnton and on the A89 eastbound approach to Newbridge, various signalling improvements for smoother flow of traffic and enhanced bus stops at key locations. Led by the City of Edinburgh Council, the South East Scotland Transport Transition Group has worked with bus operators and SEStran to develop the measures, which it is estimated could reduce journey times by up to 12 minutes in some areas.",

          "rawText": "Yunex Traffic has been awarded a contract by Midlothian Council to install and commission a new hosted UTC-UX solution and to implement MOVA capability at 15 strategic sites across the region. The new solution will include bus priority functionality at these key junctions, making bus travel more reliable, more efficient and more attractive, to encourage road users to switch from private cars to more sustainable public transport. In conjunction with the MOVA upgrade, a new bus priority functionality will be integrated with the existing Ticketer contactless payment system on the Lothian bus route, which operates south of Edinburgh through the towns of Dalkeith, Bonnyrigg and Penicuik. Real-time data on bus location and timetable adherence will be transmitted to Yunex Traffic’s hosted UTC-UX server, allowing dynamic traffic signal adjustments to be implemented to prioritise buses and optimise bus flow on the route. Vehicle detection at junctions will primarily be by Multi Lane Radar (MLR) technology, with secure 4G communications ensuring seamless data transfer to the UTC-UX platform. Wayne Clark, Midlothian Council said: “Improving the reliability and predictability of our bus services is a key priority for Midlothian Council, as we work to make public transport a more attractive and sustainable choice for our residents. We selected Yunex Traffic as they understood our requirements and offered a cost-effective solution that delivers both enhanced bus priority and a platform for delivering wider traffic management capabilities. Their expertise and innovative approach give us confidence that this project will deliver real benefits for both passengers and the local road network.” Wilke Reints, Managing Director of Yunex Traffic UK, said: “We’re delighted to be working with Midlothian Council on this new project, which will deliver real benefits for public transport users across the region. By combining our hosted UTC-UX platform with MOVA technology and real-time bus data, we’re enabling smarter, more responsive traffic management that prioritises more sustainable travel. This is a great example of how innovation can support modal shift and help build greener, more efficient transport networks.” Virtual trigger locations will be defined and used to request bus priority, with the UTC-UX system configured to action these requests on street and in real time. Unlike traditional SCOOT-based bus priority methods, this project will utilise MOVA for bus prioritisation, delivering a more responsive and efficient approach. The contract also includes the replacement of ST950 controllers and installation of new Yutraffic Actis signal heads at selected sites, providing enhanced visibility, energy efficiency, and durability. These advanced signal heads will improve reliability and reduce maintenance requirements, ensuring safer intersections and supporting the council’s sustainability goals. Yunex Traffic’s Consultancy Services team will play a central role throughout the project, from initial site surveys to MOVA validation to verifying that bus priority requests are successfully implemented. The team brings extensive experience from the delivery of UTC-UX, bus priority and MOVA schemes across the UK, most recently in South Lanarkshire.",

The new drive-thru station marks Fastned’s second major investment in Northern Ireland, expanding the region’s ultra-rapid charging capacity and supporting the growing number of EV drivers. The Antrim station features three 400kW ultra-rapid chargers and provides six charging spots, with the capability to expand to 12 in the future. Designed with Fastned’s signature yellow canopy powered by 100% renewable energy, the hub offers drivers up to 100 miles of range in just five minutes. The Antrim hub’s drive-thru design ensures easy access for all types of EVs, making it an ideal stop for drivers travelling to and from Belfast and the surrounding areas. Given its location, drivers can make the most of their time by enjoying nearby restaurants and facilities while charging. Following the successful launch of its Banbridge station in February, Fastned’s expansion in Northern Ireland demonstrates its commitment to accelerating the transition to electric mobility. With ultra-rapid charging currently accounting for just 4.5% of the region’s 687 public chargers, Fastned’s growing presence will significantly enhance the charging network for Northern Ireland’s 23,000 EV drivers. Tom Hurst, UK and Ireland Country Director at Fastned, said: “We’re delighted to open our second ultra-rapid charging station in Northern Ireland. With the Antrim hub, we are continuing to provide drivers with reliable, fast and renewable charging options, helping to build confidence in the EV transition. Northern Ireland has huge potential for EV growth and we’re committed to expanding further to meet the rising demand for clean, convenient transport. Chris Flynn, Centre Director at The Junction, added: “We are delighted to welcome Fastned to The Junction. The ultra-rapid EV station will be a great addition to the scheme, with a huge range of restaurants and cafes, and convenient access to the M2 Motorway, The Junction is a great location for drivers to stop off and re-charge. Fastned has now invested over three million pounds in its Northern Ireland stations and the company is eager to expand further. However, challenges in securing high-capacity grid connections remain a significant barrier to scaling up the UK’s charging infrastructure.

          "rawText": "Following the launch of its first ultra-rapid charging station in Banbridge last month, Dutch company Fastned has now opened another fast-charging facility in Antrim. Located at The Junction Retail & Leisure Park and described as a “state-of-the-art charging hub”, the new Antrim station features three 400kW ultra-rapid chargers and six charging spots, with the capability to expand to 12 in the future. Fastned say the new hub is “powered by 100 per cent renewable energy” and can offer drivers up to 100 miles of range with just a five minute charge. This new drive-thru station marks Fastned’s second major investment in the north, bringing its total investment here to £3m. “We’re delighted to open our second ultra-rapid charging station in Northern Ireland, said Tom Hurst, UK and Ireland country director at Fastned. With the Antrim hub, we are continuing to provide drivers with reliable, fast and renewable charging options, helping to build confidence in the EV transition. Northern Ireland has huge potential for EV growth and we’re committed to expanding further to meet the rising demand for clean, convenient transport. According to Fastned, ultra-rapid charging currently accounts for just 4.5 per cent of the north’s 687 public charging facilities, serving 23,000 EV drivers.",

In this plan we consider how passengers travel to and from the airport, the extent of the airport’s economic impact and how we support our local community. It is important for us to look at how any development of East Midlands Airport can be sustainable long term, and how this will impact our local area. We are ambitious for the development of the airport and our region. Our aim is to deepen the role that we play in the Midlands; driving growth through effortless travel and seamless trade; creating jobs and attracting investment and enabling our passengers to enjoy their travel to their favourite destinations from their local airport. As we grow, we are committed to growing the airport in a responsible and sustainable way working with our partners to minimise disturbance and reduce emissions. We are working together with our airline customers and our partners across the East Midlands to develop the airport and bring maximum benefit to the region. We also want to make sure that our plans are up to date to meet the opportunities and challenges of the future.

          "rawText": "As World Environment Day is marked today, more than 60 vehicles involved in airport operations are now running on biodiesel instead of fossil-based diesel. These include airfield operations and security team vehicles, fire trucks and snow clearing vehicles. The airport has worked with biodiesel supplier YourNRG to bring about the change, which comes as its parent company, Manchester Airports Group (MAG), launches its five-year Sustainability Strategy, ‘Creating a sustainable future for all.’ This pledges to transition its airports – Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands – to net zero carbon operations by 2038. East Midlands Airport has been carbon neutral since 2012 and was the UK’s first airport to be certified carbon neutral by the Airport Carbon Accreditation scheme. The airport has implemented a range of decarbonisation measures at the site, including investing in energy efficiency measures, installing commercial grade wind turbines and using 100% electricity from renewable sources. Over the last year, the airport has introduced two new electric ‘ambulifts’ which transport passengers with reduced mobility to aircraft, and installed electric vehicle (EV) charging points for vehicles operating on the airfield. In other initiatives, the airport also diverts 100% of its waste from landfill, and uses car parking revenue to improve public transport options to access the site. The airport’s biodiesel is produced from waste vegetable oils and fats which undergo a hydrogen treatment to be turned into renewable fuel which reduces carbon emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil diesel. It also drastically lowers particulate emissions and is biodegradable, making it safer for the environment than traditional diesel. East Midlands Airport’s Managing Director, Steve Griffiths, said: “We are always looking at ways to reduce our impact on the environment, with the aim of hitting Manchester Airport Group’s target of achieving net zero operations by 2038. Working with YourNRG to convert our fleet of ground vehicles is a great step forward, with significant emissions reductions and other environmental benefits.” Lee Reason, Commercial Director at Your NRG, said: \"We're proud to support East Midlands Airport on its journey toward decarbonisation. By transitioning their operational fleet to HVO Fuel, they've taken a major step in reducing emissions without compromising on performance. It's a powerful example of how sustainable alternatives can deliver real impact today. As more organisations commit to ambitious climate goals, HVO Fuel offers a practical, low-carbon solution to help get them there faster.\"",

          "rawText": "Utility company Anglian Water has now embarked on the biggest drinking water grid project for a generation in the UK, with the first pipes being laid down in Lincolnshire that will see the county connected with the rest of the region to protect the driest part of the country from water shortages. This is the first scheme for the Strategic Pipeline Alliance (SPA), which will be building up to 500km of interconnecting pipes – which means that it will be even longer than HS2! It forms part of the water supplier’s Water Resources Management Plan, which intends to make the east more resilient to drought over the next 25 years. If action isn’t taken, the region would see a water deficit of 30 million litres a day by 2025, which is a shortfall of 4,380 Olympic swimming pools of water each year. The long-term project is therefore essential in addressing the expected imbalance in the future, where water demand greatly outstrips supply in the east. This is the biggest challenge that Anglian Water now faces, driven by population growth, climate change and its location in the most water-scarce region of the UK. The new strategic water mains will see water taken to the south and east of the region, where it is less readily available. Local resilience will also be strengthened by the pipeline through the reduction of the number of homes and businesses relying on a single water source. The SPA will be using the very latest technology to achieve its goals, such as virtually waterless pipe testing. This sees engineers using equipment that allows them to lay pipes to a food grade standard of hygiene and disinfected using a significantly reduced amount of water than in traditional mains laying. Peter Simpson, CEO for Anglian Water, said: “We operate in the driest part of the country, and receive a third less rainfall than anywhere else in the UK, but are also one of the fastest growing regions, with 175,000 new homes to be built in the next five years. “Without action we will face a water deficit of millions of litres a day within the next five years – let alone 25 years.” The water company has also just launched a sustainability-linked bond that is connected directly to achieving its interim carbon targets by 2025 – the first water supplier in the world to do so. The utility company has pledged to reduce its net operational carbon by 30 per cent by 2025 from 2018/2019 levels, as well as its capital carbon by 65 per cent from a 2010 baseline by the same date.",

          "rawText": "Transport for London (TfL) has confirmed the next major step in improving bus performance across the capital with the announcement of funding for Haringey, Lewisham and Southwark, as part of the Better Bus Partnerships programme. The aim of the programme is for TfL to work in partnership with boroughs to transform the bus network by investing in a range of infrastructure and operational interventions that will improve journey times, reliability and customer experience. Haringey, Lewisham and Southwark have been chosen following a competitive bidding process, which was open to all boroughs. The successful boroughs will each receive up to £10million over an expected four-year period, with funding released in stages based on the progress of each programme. The selected schemes aim to cut bus journey times by up to 30 per cent - which will make bus travel more attractive, increase overall bus ridership and offer the bus as a preferred alternative to travel by private car. Investment proposals include: new bus priority measures to improve journey times better management of roadworks to reduce delays to buses bus stop improvements to make them more pleasant places where it's safer to wait and easier to change modes of transport street improvements to make it easier and safer to walk to bus stops and stations London boroughs are responsible for around 95 per cent of streets across the capital and are vital partners in making them safer, accessible and reliable for all. They play a key role in helping to ensure that the capital's bus service is comfortable and easy for everyone to use, offering attractive journey times and providing the connections people need. TfL will now work closely with the successful boroughs throughout 2026 on design and planning, with delivery expected to commence in 2027. Full details of the schemes will be shared by the boroughs in the coming months, subject to consultation and engagement. Lorna Murphy, TfL's Director of Buses, said: \"Thank you to everyone who took the time to put bids forward. It is encouraging to see boroughs putting bus services at the heart of their communities to support sustainable transport for all and a safer, cleaner, greener London. I am delighted that we can work together with London boroughs to invest in bus priority and bus infrastructure. We now look forward to working closely with Haringey, Lewisham and Southwark over the coming years to deliver their bus schemes as part of the Better Bus Partnerships programme.\" Councillor James McAsh, Southwark Council's Cabinet Member for Clean Air, Streets & Waste, said: \"We're creating a cleaner, greener Southwark where it's easier for people to walk, cycle, and use public transport. Good bus services are vital in our borough where most households don't have a car, and we're excited to be part of the Better Bus Partnership. We look forward to working closely with our local community, Transport for London and neighbours to transform bus journeys in Southwark, as part of our wider Streets for People work to reclaim street space for community benefit.\" Councillor Louise Krupski, Lewisham Council's Cabinet Member for Climate Action, Transport and Environment, said: \"We are thrilled to receive this crucial funding support from Transport for London. We are committed to making bus travel quicker, easier and more reliable for everyone. Almost half of our households do not own a car, so buses are a lifeline for many residents, especially in the south of the borough where there are fewer train connections and higher levels of deprivation. This really is a gamechanger. It will allow us to improve bus priority on key routes and make changing between buses and other transport easier. This means people can get where they need to go faster and more comfortably. We're focusing on two vital corridors - north to south through Grove Park to Greenwich and east to west through Sydenham towards Bromley and Southwark to ensure our bus network works well for everyone. We are upgrading bus stops, connecting better with stations and also improving walking and cycling routes where we can to make them safer and more pleasant, whilst reducing delays on roads.\" Councillor Mike Hakata, Haringey Council's Cabinet Member for Climate Action, Environment and Transport, said: \"Buses are essential for Haringey residents, especially those on the lowest incomes, with over 50 per cent of borough residents not owning a car - rising even higher the further east you go. Optimising these services in collaboration with TfL must be one of our priorities to ensure access to jobs, education, healthcare and community hubs, particularly in more deprived areas including Tottenham and Wood Green. We are delighted to have secured this major funding, which provides a significant opportunity to expand on the bold measures we're already taking to make bus travel safer, quicker and more reliable. This isn't just about moving from A to B - this programme will support the comprehensive regeneration of Wood Green, Tottenham and Green Lanes as thriving metropolitan centres and sustainable, safe, attractive neighbourhoods that will enable growth in jobs, services and affordable housing. We'll engage with our communities to see how they'd like to improve bus travel in their area.\"",

          "rawText": "TotalEnergies and SSE have signed a binding agreement to create a joint venture to establish a new major player in EV charging infrastructure in the UK and Ireland, under the brand 'Source'. The new business will deploy in both countries up to 3000 high power charge points, meeting demand from EV and fleet owners to provide fast and reliable charging. Within the next 5 years, Source will deploy up to 3000 high power charge points (of 150 kW and more) grouped in 300 'EV hubs', targeting 20% market share. Charging hubs will be in prime locations in and around urban areas and powered by renewable energy provided by SSE and TotalEnergies. Several hubs are already under construction with plans for dozens more, currently in development studies. In the UK, Source will provide the reliable ultra-fast charging infrastructure needed across the country to meet the demand from EV drivers and fleet operators. This demand was recently triggered by the enforcement into law of the UK Government’s zero vehicle emissions mandate for all new cars and vans, raising power supply infrastructure for EV and fleet owners as one of the biggest challenges facing the decarbonisation of transport. Similarly in Ireland, Source’s plans will help accelerate action to meet the government target of placing almost 1 million electric vehicles on roads by 2030, while building consumer confidence in EV charging. Mathieu Soulas Senior Vice President New Mobilities at TotalEnergies said: 'TotalEnergies is proud to contribute to the development of electric mobility to decarbonize transportation in the UK and Ireland. This is a great opportunity to extend our network in Europe and stake out a key position as a reference high-power charging player. We want to offer our customers - passenger cars and fleet alike - a nationwide, ultra-fast and reliable charging service that allows them to travel efficiently with complete peace of mind. This development also contributes to our integrated power strategy in the UK, combining renewable and flexible power generation capacity, trading and marketing of low-carbon electricity available 24 hours a day.' Neil Kirkby Managing Director of Enterprise at SSE said: 'SSE is already playing a leading role in decarbonising the UK and Ireland’s power system including building the world’s largest offshore wind farm and transforming electricity networks. Now this agreement will help accelerate progress towards a decarbonised transport system too, ensuring the vehicles that keep the economy moving can do so in a more sustainable and efficient way.'",

The solution overcomes grid limitations in coastal areas, ensuring reliable and efficient charging for electric boating areas with limited grid capacity. Environmental sensors installed at all charging sites by the University of Plymouth provide valuable data, confirming the positive environmental impact of this shift to cleaner marine travel. The completion of The Electric Seaway builds on the legacy of the Marine eCharging Living Lab (MeLL) project, expanding the UK’s first marine charging network into a scalable model with global potential. The initiative has not only delivered on its technical objectives but also fostered economic growth. Partners like ZPN Energy have refined processes for efficient site delivery, ensuring scalable and practical deployment of charging stations along the UK’s south coast.",
