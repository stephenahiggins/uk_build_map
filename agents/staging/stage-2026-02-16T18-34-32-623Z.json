The project, which aimed to bring cutting-edge connectivity to high-demand public spaces, has gone live with operational 5G networks in several key locations, including Cardiff and Bath. The delivery was carried out in collaboration with leading UK and international partners and powered by IS-Wireless’ innovative Liquid RAN technology, a new generation of open, disaggregated radio networks, which focuses on extremely efficient use of communication resources (computing and spectrum). Liquid RAN enables significant savings in network deployment costs and energy consumption. This achievement demonstrates not only the power of open and flexible 5G solutions, but also how effectively public and private entities can work together to deliver great solutions for end users. As a European technology provider, we are happy to have delivered live 5G connectivity in such demanding areas. said Sławomir Pietrzyk, CEO at IS-Wireless. We’ve done great work on the RIC and xApps to achieve energy savings. When the area is busy, the cells can be powered up. Overnight, or when the streets are not so busy, the cells will be powered down. It’s been a great collaboration. said Peter Gradwell, Chief Commercial Officer at Telet and Programme Lead for the ONE WORD programme. The project delivered robust 5G coverage in Cardiff’s city centre and Bath & North East Somerset region, including stadium environments, showing how open networks can serve dense urban areas, improve public connectivity, and enable future smart services. This success is a result of close cooperation with various partners, including Telet, West of England Combined Authority, Bath & North East Somerset Council, Cardiff Council, Shropshire Council, Worcestershire County Council, and Lancaster University. The initiative was part of the UK Government’s Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) programme to accelerate the adoption of Open RAN solutions and drive innovation in mobile connectivity.",

The project involves proposals to upgrade the electricity transmission network between Lincolnshire and the East Midlands by building approximately 60km of new high voltage overhead line and two new substations, one near Corby Glen, Lincolnshire and one near Wartnaby in Leicestershire. The proposals also include the upgrade (reconductoring) of approximately 55km of existing overhead line between East Leicestershire and the existing Grendon substation in Northamptonshire. National Grid’s proposals form part of The Great Grid Upgrade – the biggest investment in the electricity network in Britain for a generation. As the UK accelerates its transition to cleaner and more secure forms of energy, we need to upgrade our network of overhead lines, pylons, cables and other infrastructure that transports electricity around the country. These new projects are vital upgrades to meet the growing demand for electricity in the years ahead, including in Leicestershire and Lincolnshire where demand is expected to double. The new power line is needed to allow more electricity to flow from where it is being produced along the East Coast of Britain, to where it is needed in homes and businesses across Lincolnshire and between the north and the Midlands and between the Midlands and the south. This will reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels, which are often expensive and affected by global market pressures. This will help to make Britain’s energy more secure and independent, delivering long-term benefits to bill payers. Ben Muncey, Project Director for Weston Marsh to East Leicestershire, commented: “This reinforcement between Weston Marsh and East Leicestershire is essential to meet the UK’s forecasted energy demand doubling by 2050 and is part of a wider programme to upgrade the entire network. As our demand for electricity grows, this project will connect our homes, businesses and public services to sources of home‑grown British energy, making us more energy independent. We look forward to hearing views from members of the public and we welcome feedback on our proposals.”",

This significant investment recognises the economic growth potential of the Carlisle Station Gateway Project and the role that additional funding can play in unlocking further development opportunities for the city and wider region. The Carlisle Station Gateway Project has already benefitted from investment through the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal with a £27 million first phase of development, which will transform Carlisle Station and its surroundings, improve accessibility and create a modern gateway to the city and beyond. The new £13.504 million will form a capped contribution to the existing partnership project between Cumberland Council and Network Rail, adding to the overall funding envelope already in place. It will be made available to Network Rail to progress key elements of the scheme. Within this financial year, the funding is expected to support: Design and construction work at George Square Design and construction work at Court Square Land development to the south of the station and enabling works Station change activities Business case development Operational costs, including staff and signage The full scope of the Carlisle Station Gateway Project will also include essential station accessibility improvements and interior works to meet forecast demand and support the remodelled city centre. Over £100 million is being invested in high-quality schemes in the Carlisle area that will help reshape the heart of the city into a greener, more dynamic place. These projects will enhance accessibility, support local growth, and help build a city centre that’s fit for the future. Cllr Mark Fryer, Leader of Cumberland Council and Borderlands Partnership Board member, said: “This investment is a major step forward for Carlisle’s regeneration. The Carlisle Station Gateway Project will not only transform the station environment but also create opportunities for economic growth and improved connectivity for residents and visitors alike. It is positive to see further investment on the back of the initial Borderlands Deal funding. “These enhanced facilities will continue the station’s transformation, creating spaces that are more attractive, accessible, and welcoming, ensuring that when people arrive in Carlisle, they are greeted by a station that reflects the city’s vibrancy and ambition, and sets the tone for exploring everything our area has to offer.” Julie Minns, MP Carlisle, added: ''This additional £13.5 million is a further sign of the confidence this Government has in Carlisle’s future. Across the city we are seeing significant levels of public investment, from the Citadel campus and neighbourhood renewal schemes to improvements in our high streets and public spaces. The Station Gateway Project adds to this progress and will help deliver a modern, accessible and welcoming entrance to the city that reflects the pride we all share in Carlisle. “This funding will deliver practical improvements that people will feel in their everyday lives. Better connectivity, safer and more attractive public spaces and improved access to rail services will support local businesses, encourage more people into the city centre and strengthen Carlisle’s position as a place where people want to live, study, visit, and invest.'' Hannah Clarke, Network Rail’s project sponsor, agreed and said: “Carlisle station is a beautiful piece of railway heritage and an important gateway to the city. This investment will transform the experience for the thousands of passengers who use the station every day, making it easier to navigate, more accessible, and better connected to the city centre. We're working closely with Cumberland Council and Avanti West Coast to deliver improvements that passengers will see and feel from spring 2026.",
