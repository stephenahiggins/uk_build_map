# Evidence Creation LLM Agents

This directory contains documentation and setup instructions for building automated agents that gather project evidence from the web. Agents are written in TypeScript and call language models via the PortKey AI Gateway so providers can be switched through configuration. Example virtual keys are provided for OpenAI and Google Gemini.
